    "Programmers use stubs as temporary versions of functions or modules while developing software. These stubs act as placeholders when certain parts of a program aren’t ready yet. They are useful for unit testing, where developers check if a specific function works correctly without needing every part of the system to be finished. Stubs also help teams work in parallel, allowing one group to keep building their section while another finishes a required component. Additionally, when dealing with complex systems, programmers use stubs to simulate interactions with external services or complicated logic, making testing easier."

    "Version control is a system that keeps track of all the changes made to a program. It’s important because it allows developers to undo mistakes, restore previous versions, and see how the project has evolved. Since many developers often work on the same code, version control helps avoid conflicts by allowing multiple people to edit different sections without overwriting each other’s work. It also enables teams to create branches, which means they can test new features separately before merging them into the main project. Overall, version control keeps development organized and prevents accidental data loss."

    "Code optimization is the process of making a program run faster and use less memory. One way to do this is by choosing efficient algorithms, which means using smarter methods to solve problems with fewer steps. Developers also try to reduce memory usage by removing unnecessary variables and using better ways to store data. Another strategy is avoiding redundant calculations, which means not repeating work that has already been done. Additionally, compilers (which convert code into a format the computer can run) often apply automatic improvements, like reordering instructions to make execution smoother."
